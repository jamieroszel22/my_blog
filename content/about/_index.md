I'm Jamie Roszel, a Content Developer with expertise in technical documentation and software development. I currently work with IBM Cloud Databases, where I manage documentation for multiple database offerings and maintain comprehensive API and CLI documentation.

## Technical Focus
- Documentation as Code (Markdown, reStructuredText, DITA XML)
- API Documentation & Technical Writing
- Database Technologies & Cloud Solutions
- Software Development & GitHub
- Content Management Systems (AEM, FrameMaker)

## Recent Work
At IBM Cloud Databases, I:
- Manage documentation for 9 database offerings
- Create and maintain CLI and API documentation
- Develop client-facing tutorials and troubleshooting guides
- Collaborate with UI/UX teams on product documentation

## Background
My unique background combines technical content development with educational experience. As a former English teacher at Cary Academy, I developed skills in effectively communicating complex concepts. This foundation, combined with my software engineering certificate from General Assembly, enables me to bridge the gap between technical complexity and clear communication.
